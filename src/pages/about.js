                <h2>Hacktoberfest Lore</h2>
                <p>
                    Hacktoberfest is DigialOcean’s annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source
                    throughout October. Much of modern tech infrastructure—including some of DigitalOcean’s own
                    products—relies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often don’t
                    have the staff or budgets to do much more than keep the project alive. Hacktoberfest is all about
                    giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially
                    the people that make open source so special.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the past 9 years, thousands of people—coders and non-coders alike—have participated in
                    Hacktoberfest to support the projects they use and love, learn and practice skills that will enhance
                    their careers, and meet new people who love open source as much as they do.

                <h2>Advisory Council</h2>
                <p>
                    Each year, we bring together a talented group of open-source superfans who help ensure that
                    Hacktoberfest is accessible, inclusive, and enriching for both contributors and maintainers.

                <p>
                    Hacktoberfest isn’t all about code. Keyboard jockeys who write, design, test, mentor, or organize
                    all offer much needed support for open source projects all over the world.
